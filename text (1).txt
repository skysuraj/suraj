An algorithm is a procedure or step-by-step instruction for solving a problem. They form the foundation of writing a program.

For writing any programs, the following has to be known:

Input
Tasks to be preformed
Output expected
For any task, the instructions given to a friend is different from the instructions given to a computer. Letâ€™s look at the difference between them and know how to give instructions to a computer.

Instruction to a Friend:
Step 1: Go to the College Board.

Step 2: Search for my name on the board.

Step 3: Check the rank against my name.

Instructions to the Computer:
Step 1: Go to the College Board.

Step 2: Read the first name.

Step 3: If this is my name, see rank and come back.

Step 4: Read the next name.

Step 5: Repeat the above two steps until you find my name.

Breaking down the steps into smaller steps is called algorithm.
